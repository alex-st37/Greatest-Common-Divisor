# Greatest-Common-Divisor

This program calculates the greatest common divisor of the two numbers entered by the user.
The greatest common divisor (GCD), also called the greatest common factor, of two numbers is the largest number that divides them both.
For example, the greatest common divisor of 28 and 48 is 4.

## Features

The user has the posibility to enter to integers from the keyboard.
If at least one of the numbers entered has the value 0 or a negative value, the program prints out -1.
If the numbers are positive, the program returns their greatest common divisor.

## About the Coding

The program is written in Java. I used two methods to resolve this challenge. The first one, which is commented in the source file, uses for loops to loop through the possible divisors. The second one, which is currently used to work the program, uses while loops for the same purpose.

## How to Run the Program

I've also added in the directory a .jar file of the program which can be ran on your desktop devices.

## Future Features
1. Implementing the possibility to determine the greatest common divisor of more than two numbers.
2. Adding a GUI to the program.
